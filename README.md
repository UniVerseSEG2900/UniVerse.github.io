UniVerse universal translation glasses are a hyper-intelligent, AI-powered communication tool. It translates speech or text in real-time and displays the translated message on the inside of the lenses for only the user to read. This can be changed to audio read-outs if a user does not want the subtitles. 

Features:
- Voice control 
- AI - Talk about how it’s incorporated 
- Text to speech
- Accent and tone adjustment 
- Real time subtitles 
- Mobile app
